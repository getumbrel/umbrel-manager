# ‚òÇÔ∏è manager

Manager runs by-default on [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os) as a containerized service. It provides a low-level system API that handles:
- User authentication using JWT
- Encryption/decryption of sensitive information, such as the lightning wallet's seed
- CRUD operations
- Lifecycle-management of all other containerized services

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are looking to run Umbrel on your hardware, you do not need to run this service on it's own. Just download [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/releases) and you're good to go.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Umbrel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
